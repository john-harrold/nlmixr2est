\usage{
nlmixr2Pred(object, ..., ipred = FALSE)

\method{predict}{nlmixr2FitData}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{is a either a rxode2 family of objects, or a file-name
with a rxode2 model specification, or a string with a rxode2
model specification.}

\item{...}{Other arguments including scaling factors for each
compartment.  This includes S# = numeric will scale a compartment
# by a dividing the compartment amount by the scale factor,
like NONMEM.}

\item{ipred}{Flag to calculate individual predictions. When
\code{ipred} is \code{TRUE}, calculate individual predictions.
When \code{ipred} is \code{FALSE}, set calculate typical population predictions.
When \code{ipred} is \code{NA}, calculate both individual and
population predictions.}
}
\value{
an rxode2 solved data frame with the predictions
